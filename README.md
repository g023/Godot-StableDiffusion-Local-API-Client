# Godot StableDiffusion Local API Client

Godot StableDiffusion Local API Client is a Godot 4+ example for utilizing a backend API, such as Automatic1111, to generate StableDiffusion AI images using Godot. Settings configured in the web interface seamlessly transfer to the Godot client.

## Overview

This project serves as a demonstration of integrating StableDiffusion AI image generation into Godot game engine projects. It allows developers to leverage the power of AI-generated imagery within their Godot applications, enhancing visual experiences and enabling dynamic content creation.

## Features

- Seamless integration with StableDiffusion AI backend API.
- WebUI settings automatically synchronized to the Godot client.
- Compatible with Godot 4+.
- Demonstrates using StableDiffusion APIs in Godot projects.

## Installation

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Godot 4+.
3. Ensure your Godot project is configured to allow internet access for API communication.
4. Make sure your Automatic1111 StableDiffusion API is running (webui --api)
5. Run the project. (will show an error if no server detected until server launched)

## Usage

1. Launch your StableDiffusion local API (automatic1111 users add the --api flag to your webui on launch)
2. Launch the Godot project.
3. Access the web interface to configure advanced settings for AI image generation.
4. Changes made in the web interface will automatically sync with the Godot client.
5. Utilize the generated AI images within your Godot application as desired.
